# read abelectronics ADC Pi V2 board inputs with repeating reading from each channel and save to a log file with timestamp
# uses quick2wire from http://quick2wire.com/ github: https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-python-api
# Requries Python 3 
# GPIO API depends on Quick2Wire GPIO Admin. To install Quick2Wire GPIO Admin, follow instructions at http://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin
# I2C API depends on I2C support in the kernel

# Version 1.0  - 23/11/2012
# Version History:
# 1.0 - Initial Release
# 
#
# Function Usage: getadcreading(address, port, gain, resolution) to return value in volts.
#
# address = DSPi_address1 or DSPi_address2 - Hex address of I2C chips as configured by board header pins.
# port = adc input 1-4 for ADC Chips, ports 5-8 are referenced as 1-4 in code with DSPi_address2 as chip address.
# gain use 0 for 1x gain
# gain use 1 for 2x gain
# gain use 2 for 4x gain
# gain use 3 for 8x gain
# resolution use 0 for 12 bit
# resolution use 1 for 14 bit
# resolution use 2 for 16 bit
# resolution use 3 for 18 bit.
